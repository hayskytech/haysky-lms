	<h1>Dictionaries</h1>
	<p>A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with
		curly brackets, and they have keys and values.</p>
	<p>Example: Create and print a dictionary:</p>
	<pre>
thisdict = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
	</pre>
	<h3>Accessing Items:</h3>
	<p>You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:</p>
	<pre>x = thisdict["model"]</pre>
	<p>There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:</p>
	<pre>x = thisdict.get("model")</pre>
	<h3>Change Values</h3>
	<p>You can change the value of a specific item by referring to its key name:<br />Change the "year" to 2018</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018
</pre>
	<h3>Loop Through a Dictionary</h3>
	<p>You can loop through a dictionary by using a for loop. When looping through a dictionary, the return value are the
		keys of the dictionary, but there are methods to return the values as well.
	</p>
	<p>Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:</p>
	<pre>for x in thisdict:
	print(x)</pre>
	<p>Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:</p>
	<pre>for x in thisdict:
	print(thisdict[x])</pre>
	<p>You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:</p>
	<pre>for x in thisdict.values():
	print(x)</pre>
	<p>Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:</p>
	<pre>for x, y in thisdict.items():
	print(x, y)</pre>

	<h3>Check if Key Exists</h3>
	<p>To determine if a specified key is present in a dictionary use the in keyword:<br>Check if "model" is present in
		the dictionary:</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
	print("Yes")</pre>
	<h3>Dictionary Length</h3>
	<p>To determine how many items (key-value pairs) a dictionary has, use the len() function.
		<br>Example: Print the number of items in the dictionary:
	</p>
	<pre>print(len(thisdict))</pre>
	<h3>Adding Items:</h3>
	<p>Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)
</pre>
	<h3>Removing Items</h3>
	<p>There are several methods to remove items from a dictionary</p>
	<p>The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)</pre>
	<p>The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead)</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)</pre>
	<p>The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)
</pre>
	<p>The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) 
# this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.</pre>
	<p>thisdict.clear() will remove all items.</p>
	<h3>Copy a Dictionary</h3>
	<p>You cannot copy a dictionary simply by typing dict2 = dict1, because: dict2 will only be a reference to dict1, and
		changes made in dict1 will automatically also be made in dict2.</p>
	<p>There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in Dictionary method copy(). Make a copy of a dictionary
		with the copy() method:</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)
</pre>
	<p>Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in function dict().</p>
	<p>Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:</p>
	<pre>thisdict = {
	"brand": "Ford",
	"model": "Mustang",
	"year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)</pre>

	<h3>Nested Dictionaries</h3>
	<p>A dictionary can also contain many dictionaries, this is called nested dictionaries.</p>
	<p>Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries</p>
	<pre>myfamily = {
	"child1" : {
		"name" : "Emil",
		"year" : 2004
		},
	"child2" : {
		"name" : "Tobias",
		"year" : 2007
		},
	"child3" : {
		"name" : "Linus",
		"year" : 2011
		}
}</pre>
	<p>Or, if you want to nest three dictionaries that already exists as dictionaries:
		<br />Example: Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
	</p>
	<pre>child1 = {
	"name" : "Emil",
	"year" : 2004
}
	child2 = {
	"name" : "Tobias",
	"year" : 2007
}
	child3 = {
	"name" : "Linus",
	"year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
	"child1" : child1,
	"child2" : child2,
	"child3" : child3
}</pre>

	<h3>The dict() Constructor</h3>
	<p>It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a new dictionary</p>
	<pre>thisdict = dict(brand="Ford", model="Mustang", year=1964)
# note that keywords are not string literals
# note the use of equals rather than colon for the assignment
print(thisdict)</pre>
	<p>Dictionary Methods: Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on dictionaries.</p>
